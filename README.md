# UE4_CustomLiDAR_Public

## This plugin is designed to reproduce your preferred LiDAR specifications by manipulating parameters.<br>
### ※This is only a personal production.

### For example, the following settings are available<br>
###・View angle (vertical, horizontal)<br>
###・Maximum measurement distance<br>
###・Gaussian noise<br>
###・Frequency(Hz)<br>
###・Resolution<br>

### We recommend that the minimum resolution be kept around 0.2 because of the CPU calculations.

### Acquired data can also be output as csv file that can be converted to Point Cloudn.

## See play demo.
